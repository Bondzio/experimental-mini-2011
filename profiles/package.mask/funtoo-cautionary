# udev-182 removed some feature that is now taken care of in consolekit.
# Masking the latest version of consolekit as it depends on >=udev-182.

# Mask _pre python ebuilds as they require mercurial which breaks metro (could be worked around but is less than ideal anyway)
# People can unmask 'em if they need them.

# udev-177 is not ready for daily usage
# for adventurous ones!
# Jean-Francis Roy (21 May 2012)
# Update mask for >171-r6 as new udev versions are about to be added for testing.
>sys-fs/udev-171-r6

# DO NOT USE this one the ebuild does not include kernel revision dependencies (>= 2.6.38 REQUIRED) and it can affect many of our users 
# See bug #359445
